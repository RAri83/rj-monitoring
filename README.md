ðŸ˜‰ System monitoring and running processes using PowerShell and announcements in Discord with Webhook

Two versions of system monitoring software using PowerShell.
It has 2 versions with user interface and command line version.

The software needs Webhook to transfer the output to Discord.
In the command line version it is mandatory but in the version with a user interface, if you dont do it, there will be no problem.

ðŸ“Œ To get a better output, run the software using Run As Administrator.
